# James

This is Jame's repo. This code has been changed from Discord Bot maker to NodeJS first with Discord.js and it is currently on Eris

This bot was the main thing that I was working on until someone wanted a custom bot off me.

### Notes
1. I am aware of very bad bits of code which I shouldn't do [example](https://github.com/flamableassassin/james/blob/99cd56bea3dc729d6e9ffc374406c1b3d893ec33/src/events/message.js#L62)
2. Don't use this code unedited it has many mistakes in.
